# PHP and MySQL
Training bootcamp at software engineering internship at Glisland Inc. \
Consists of 30 lessons for HTML, PHP, and MySQL
#### Lesson 1: Setting up Your Workspace
In this lesson, you will create a PHP file and run it to test your PHP setup.

#### Lesson 2: Adding PHP to a Web Page
In this lesson, you will take the content out of the home page and put it in a separate file, and include it back into the index.php page so that you will be able reuse the same page to show different types of content.

#### Lesson 3: Learning PHP Syntax
In this lesson, you will learn to put comments into your PHP code.

#### Lesson 4: Working with Variables
In this lesson, you will start changing the actual static information in the case study to variables, and use those variables to display your information on the web page. You will also use functions to change the appearance of variables and you will start using some calculations in order to calculate out some of the classes that you were using for your CSS.

#### Lesson 5: Debugging Code
In this lesson, you will debug some code and look at the Xdebug that's available on the Eclipse PDT.

#### Lesson 6: Working with Complex Data
In this lesson, you will change the numeral variables that we have in the gents.php file into a nested array that consists of a numerical array at the higher level... followed by a nested array that is associated using named keys.

#### Lesson 7: Making Decisions
In this lesson, you will use the $\_Get parameters from the url along with the conditional statements that you learned earlier in this lesson to create a dynamic menu system that tells the program what kind of content to display.

#### Lesson 8: Repeating Program Steps
In this lesson, you will create a program that displays the even numbers by using an array that loops through using the for loop. You will also change the case study gents.php file so that rather than doing duplicating code 3 times... you will use a foreach loop to loop through an array and print out each line to the screen using one set of code.

#### Lesson 9: Learning about Scope
In this lesson, you will set a variable to global and use super globals to display information about your server.

#### Lesson 10: Reusing Code with Functions
In this lesson, you will set up a case study so that it can handle functions and you will create a function for loading the content which you will then able to reload to add additional content in a different place.

#### Lesson 11: Creating Forms
In this lesson, you will create a form that allows people to enter a temperature and then convert it from Fahrenheit to celsius or celsius to Fahrenheit.

#### Lesson 12: Introducing Object-Oriented Programming
In this lesson, you will analyze the aboutus page to see what properties, pieces of information, or facts about the contacts of what you will need to create a class and about what methods some actions you might want to perform for the particular contacts.

#### Lesson 13: Defining Classes
In this lesson, you will create a contact class for the contacts that appear on the aboutus page in the case study. You will have a chance to add in the properties and the methods to this blueprint that will be used to create objects in the later lessons.

#### Lesson 14: Using Classes
In this lesson, you will replace the static html code on the aboutus page with objects for each of the contacts. You will also have a chance to use the \__construct method in the contact class to see how you could automatically load all of the properties for that particular object.

#### Lesson 15: Using Advanced Techniques
In this lesson, you will improve the case study by adding autoloading of the classes. You will also change the scope of the properties in the contact class to make them protected and create the appropriate getter methods to access those protected properties.

#### Lesson 16: Handling Errors
In this lesson, you will add error checking to the case study. You will check for the existence of the image files in the display of the gents and you will also add a try catch block around the autoloading of the classes.

#### Lesson 17: Writing Secure Code
In this lesson, you will add index.html files to all the folders in the case study. You will also create a form that generates a token and then checks to make sure that it has a valid token before it processes that form.

#### Lesson 18: Introducing Databases
In this lesson, you will design three database tables that we need for the case study website. Those are the contacts, the categories, and the lots.

#### Lesson 19: Introducing MySQL
In this lesson, you will create the database that you will be using for the case study smithside and you will create the first table into that database called contacts and load it with that information.

#### Lesson 20: Creating and Connecting to the Database
In this lesson, you will create a database class for the case study.It will hold a MySQLi objected oriented type of connection to the database. If you connect to the database successfully, you should be able to show a message on the case study homepage that shows that you were connected.

#### Lesson 21: Creating Tables
In this lesson, you will create the tables for the lots and the lot categories and you will also create the corresponding classes for them. In addition, you will go back to the class for the contacts and add in the missing table field into that class.

#### Lesson 22: Entering Data
In this lesson, you will add a form so that you can add contacts in your case study. You will also get a chance to go through some debugging to see how you would find errors when things are not working how you expect them to go.

#### Lesson 23: Selecting Data
In this lesson, you will learn to retrieve data from the case study database and you'll use it to populate the website in particular in the aboutus page and in the lot categories page. You'll also be able to use it to create the side menu so that it will go out to the database and create the menu base based on what it found there.

#### Lesson 24: Using Multiple Tables
In this lesson, you will join multiple tables together by using the MySQL command select with the join clause. You will do it first in phpMyAdmin, and once those commands are successful, you will move those commands over to PHP.

#### Lesson 25: Changing Data
In this lesson, you will add maintenance to the contacts table in the case study. You will modify the add pages for the contacts so that you could edit those contacts using the same form to create new contacts.
