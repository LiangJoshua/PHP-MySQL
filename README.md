# PHP and MySQL 
Training bootcamp at software engineering internship at Glisland Inc. \
Consists of 30 lessons for HTML, PHP, and MySQL 
#### Lesson 1: Setting up Your Workspace
In this lesson, you will create a PHP file and run it to test your PHP setup.

#### Lesson 2: Adding PHP to a Web Page
In this lesson, you will take the content out of the home page and put it in a separate file, and include it back into the index.php page so that you will be able reuse the same page to show different types of content.

#### Lesson 3: Learning PHP Syntax
In this lesson, you will learn to put comments into your PHP code.

#### Lesson 4: Working with Variables
In this lesson, you will start changing the actual static information in the case study to variables, and use those variables to display your information on the web page. You wil also use functions to change the appearnce of variables and you will start using some calculations in order to calculate out some of the classes that you were using for your CSS. 

#### Lesson 5: Debugging Code
In this lesson, you will debug some code and look at the Xdebug that's available on the Eclipse PDT.

#### Lesson 6: Working with Complex Data
In this lesson, you will change the numeral variables that we have in the gents.php file into a nested array that consists of a numerical array at the higher level... followed by a nested array that is associated using named keys. 

#### Lesson 7: Making Decisions
In this lesson, you will use the $_Get parameters from the url along with the conditional statements that you learned earlier in this lesson to create a dynamic menuing system that tells the program what kind of content to display.

#### Lesson 8: Repeating Program Steps
In this lesson, you will create a program that displays the even numbers by using an array that loops through using the for loop. You will also change the case study gents.php file so that rather than doing duplicating code 3 times... you will use a foreach loop to loop through an array and print out each line to the screen using one set of code. 

#### Lesson 9: Learning about Scope
In this lesson, you will set a variable to global and use super globals to display information about your server.

#### Lesson 10: Reusing Code with Functions
In this lesson, you will set up a case study so that it can handle functions and you will create a function for loading the content which you will then able to reload to add additional content in a different place. 

#### Lesson 11: Creating Forms
In this lesson, you will create a form that allows people to enter a temperature and then convert it from fahrenheit to celsius or celsius to fahrenheit. 

#### Lesson 12: Introducing Object-Oriented Programming
In this lesson, you will analyze the aboutus page to see what properties, pieces of information, or facts about the contacts of what you will need to create a class and about what methods some actions you might want to perform for the particular contacts.

#### Lesson 13: Defining Classes
In this lesson, you will create a contact class for the contacts that appear on the aboutus page in the case study. You will have a chance to add in the properties and the methods to this blueprint that will be used to create objects in the later lessons.

#### Lesson 14: Using Classes
In this lesson, you will replace the static html code on the aboutus page with objects for each of the contacts. You will also have a chance to use the __construct method in the contact class to see how you could automatically load all of the properities for that particular object.

### Lesson 15: Using Advanced Techniques
In this lesson, you will improve the case study by adding autoloading of the classes. You will also change the scope of the properties in the contact class to make them protected and create the appropriate getter methods to access those protected properties.
